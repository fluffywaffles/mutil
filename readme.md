# prettybad/Î¼til
## it's worse than underscore

In keeping with my life motto ("I bet a could make a pretty bad {x}"),
this is a pretty bad utility library. It is pretty bad, tbh. It has some
pretty bad goals:

1. Don't ignore or hide symbols
    - `key`s means "strings and symbols"
    - `symbol_keyed_*` functions refer to symbol keys
    - `string_keyed_*` functions refer to string keys
    - Seriously why isn't the  built-in library clear in the first place
2. Don't ignore or hide property descriptors
    - Merging objects merges descriptors; it doesn't just implicitly drop
      nonenumerable things
    - Updating an object doesn't implicitly make its descriptor enumerable
      and writable if it wasn't before
    - `*_propert{y,ies}` and `*_descriptor{s}` APIs exist for explicitness
3. Everything is curried all of the time
    - Composition over rice with a cup of chai tea
    - I get tired of writing out names for arguments I'm passing along
    - Point-free... erm... et cetera
4. As lodash/fp puts it, "Iteratee first, data last"
    - The data is always the last argument, e.g. `map(inc)([ 1, 2, 3 ])`
    - I could have just said that, but I think the lodash-eff-pee-ers are funnier so I copied them
5. Where it makes sense, just be polymorphic
    - Check object type tags and dispatch the correct function
    - For example, `copy` dispatches: `array_copy` on arrays, and `object_copy` on normal objects
6. Be immutable by default, but provide clearly-labeled mutative alternatives
    - e.g.: `splice` and `splice.mut`, `map` and `map.mut`, `filter` and `filter.mut`
    - Mutation should be explicit and grep-able (so, like, search for `.*\.mut(.*)`)
7. In general, don't ever do anything with prototypes
    - They're complex and inefficient to work with. Leave them alone.

Why mutative APIs? Well, uh, what for... when you performant, need the...
where we do want to, uh, do that.

But seriously: sometimes you want to mutate. For example, design-time
mutation - to set the state of an object at initialization - is perfectly
okay. In tight loops, mutation can make a huge performance difference.
Besides, in practice, perfect immutability in javascript is a lie whenever
you touch the DOM. Frameworks that espouse immutable web interfaces hide
mutation - sometimes in a compiler backend (hi, Elm) and sometimes in a
runtime (hi, React) - but the fact is, the DOM mutates, and browsers are
optimized for this.

Also, programmers are smart enough to be allowed to mutate when they want
to. I call this the "give a man a footgun" principle of API design. It has
a saying that goes... uh... "give a man a footgun, and he'll have 1 foot
and learnt a lesson, or he'll reinvent wheels." Or something like that.
One of those is supposed to be the good outcome. I can't remember which.

So there, I had reasons. Never let it be said I was unreasonable. Insane,
maybe, but only within reason.

If only someone else had already written a pretty bad utility library,
then I wouldn't be writing this one... er, wait.

Nevermind, I'm tired of making up FAQs.

# Does it work?

Yes. But unfortunately you'll have to take my word for it right now that
the tests pass. I wrote the tests using my own testing library, Sisyphus,
which I'm still in the process of... uh... fixing, before I release it.
